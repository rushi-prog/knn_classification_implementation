# knn_classification_implementation
This project demonstrates a clear and focused implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm using the Iris dataset. We systematically explored the effect of varying the hyperparameter k on model performance. Accuracy analysis across different values of k revealed that k = 8 yielded the most stable and high-performing results, with a maximum accuracy of approximately 96.67%.
This reinforces the importance of hyperparameter tuning in KNN and highlights how model performance can significantly vary with the choice of k. The project serves as a practical example of how to apply KNN to a multi-class classification problem in a reproducible and interpretable way.
